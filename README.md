## 🚩 Problem Statement

Many people struggle to choose suitable skincare products because they do not fully understand their skin type or the ingredients in products. Using the wrong products can lead to breakouts, irritation, dryness, or long-term skin damage.

SkinCircuit solves this problem by analyzing the user’s skin type and concerns and suggesting personalized products and routines.
